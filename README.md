# juypter_Snippets

This is to expand the current snippet library, especially for code bases with weaker documentaion. I struggled quite a bit when starting off with ipywidgets.  That was my inspiration for this.  I wanted to clearly define all args, kwargs, functions and attributes of this library.



Please fork, star, and add!
